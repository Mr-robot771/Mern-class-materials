I will open the relevant React files to see how the modal is implemented and how navigation is handled, so I can adjust it to close the modal and return to the table without navigating away.

Goal
When viewing a single user (UserPatch), the Back action should close the modal and return to the Users page with the table open, not navigate back a full page in history.

Analysis

- Users.jsx controls the modal open state via `open` and initializes it from `location.state.opens`.
- UserList.jsx links to the detail page using a plain `<Link to={`/Users/${user.\_id}`}>`, which doesnâ€™t pass any state.
- UserPatch.jsx currently calls `navigate(-1, { state: { opens: true } })`. Using -1 depends on browser history and can send the user away from the Users page (e.g., if opened in a new tab or different navigation path). Also, the Users page expects `location.state.opens` when it mounts.

Solution

- Pass state when navigating from the modal to the detail page so we know we came from the modal.
- In UserPatch, navigate back explicitly to the Users route with state `{ opens: true }`, ensuring the table modal opens upon return, regardless of history stack.

Implementation steps

1. Update UserList.jsx: add state to the Link so we carry forward `{ opens: true }`.
2. Update UserPatch.jsx: replace `navigate(-1, { state: { opens: true } })` with explicit navigation to the Users route, e.g., `navigate('/Users', { state: { opens: true }, replace: true })`. Using replace prevents adding another history entry.

Code changes to apply

- In UserList.jsx:
  - Change: <Link className="flex justify-center" to={`/Users/${user._id}`}>
  - To: <Link className="flex justify-center" to={`/Users/${user._id}`} state={{ opens: true }}>
- In UserPatch.jsx:
  - Change the onClick handler to: navigate('/Users', { state: { opens: true }, replace: true });

After this, when you:

- Open the modal from Users and click the eye icon, you navigate to UserPatch with state preserved.
- Click Back in UserPatch, you return to Users with `opens` true, so the modal table opens immediately rather than navigating an entire page back in browser history.
